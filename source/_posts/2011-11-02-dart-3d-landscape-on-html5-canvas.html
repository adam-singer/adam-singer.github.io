</p><p>Was looking see how simple it would be to convert some javascript to dart. The <a href="https://github.com/financeCoding/html5dartscape">"3D landscape on HTML5 Canvas"</a> code was derived by <a href="http://sebleedelisle.com/">Seb Lee-Delisle</a> example of <a href="http://sebleedelisle.com/demos/html5landscape.html">land scape on HTML5</a> Canvas. The javascript code was fully copied and pasted into a dart class with the modification of removing some javascript keywords and adding a few methods. This could prove to show how powerful migration of dart could be.  <a href="https://github.com/financeCoding/html5dartscape">GitHub project</a></p>
