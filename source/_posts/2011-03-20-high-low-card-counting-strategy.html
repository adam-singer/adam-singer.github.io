Took a ride over to <a href="http://www.nashcoding.com/">Wesley Tansey's blog</a> and checked out the blackjack simulator project there. Decided on adding card counting strategy <a href="http://wizardofodds.com/blackjack/count/highlow1.html">High-Low</a>. I used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Wong">Standford Wong</a>'s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Blackjack-Stanford-Wong/dp/0935926216">Professional Blackjack</a> as a reference.  Did not have great success with it, some tweaks need to be done on the betting strategies. Was only able to get a approx -4.10 to -3.07 return on 500,000 hands played. Either way, packing up the code <a href="https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B29MR2FlgtejZmIzODI3MjItOTE0MC00NjVlLWJiYWQtYWRhZTAzNTAzNjdi&amp;sort=name&amp;layout=list&amp;num=50">here</a> as a zip file that includes HighLowStrategy object or you can get the original code <a href="http://www.nashcoding.com/2010/10/03/a-csharp-blackjack-simulation-framework/">here</a>.
